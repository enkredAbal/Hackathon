	    <h1>Overview of Ford Motor Company</h1>
    
    <h2>Ford Motor Company and Siemens Digital Industries Software</h2>
    <p>Ford Motor Company would likely require a combination of Siemens Digital Industries Software (DISW) modules to support their comprehensive product development and production lifecycle. Here are some key modules that could be essential:</p>
    
    <h3>Key Siemens Software Modules</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Teamcenter:</strong> For managing product lifecycle, including mechanical and software components. It helps in tracking software dependencies, managing configurations, and ensuring scalability across global operations.</li>
        <li><strong>NX:</strong> For CAD design and engineering, providing a platform for mechanical design, simulation, and manufacturing planning.</li>
        <li><strong>Simcenter:</strong> Offers tools like Prescan for virtual testing and simulation, and Testlab for physical testing and data analysis. This suite supports performance engineering and validation across various automotive systems.</li>
        <li><strong>Tecnomatix:</strong> Useful for digital factory planning, simulation, and commissioning of production lines. It helps in optimizing manufacturing processes and reducing downtime.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Quantity of Licenses Required</h3>
    <p>Determining the exact quantity of licenses needed for each module depends on several factors, including the size of the engineering teams, the scope of projects, and the complexity of operations. However, here are some general guidelines:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Teamcenter:</strong> A large-scale implementation like Ford's would require hundreds to thousands of licenses, depending on global usage across different departments and locations.</li>
        <li><strong>NX:</strong> Engineering teams involved in CAD design and simulation might need several hundred licenses, considering the extensive use in mechanical design and manufacturing planning.</li>
        <li><strong>Simcenter:</strong> The number of licenses for Simcenter tools would depend on the specific testing and validation needs, potentially requiring dozens to hundreds of licenses across different teams.</li>
        <li><strong>Tecnomatix:</strong> For digital factory planning and simulation, the number of licenses could be in the tens to hundreds, depending on the scale of production line optimizations.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Recommended Distribution of Licenses</h3>
